# Manhwa, Manga, Manhua Recommender System Practice Project

This project is a simple recommender system built as a practice exercise to deepen my understanding of the foundations of recommendation algorithms. I used this project to experiment with different techniques, challenge new ideas, and analyze common problems and solutions encountered in building such systems.

## Disclaimer!!!

The dataset used in this project is not included in the repository due to its large size (which was very difficult to deal with). You can download the dataset from the following link:

## Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and learn the basic concepts behind recommender systems, such as:
- Understanding different types of recommender systems (e.g., content-based, collaborative filtering)
- Implementing a simple content-based recommendation engine using features like tags, ratings, and year of release
- Experimenting with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer` to handle categorical data like genres and tags
- Computing similarity scores using cosine similarity

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed the dataset, including handling missing values and feature extraction.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Focused on content-based recommendations using movie metadata (e.g., genres, tags, ratings).
- **Cosine Similarity**: Calculated similarity between movies based on feature vectors to recommend similar items.
- **Challenges & Learnings**: Explored common issues, such as handling high-dimensional data and computational inefficiency in similarity calculations with large datasets.
